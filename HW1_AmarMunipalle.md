# FINTECH CASE STUDY

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company?

![](logo-cropped-11.png)

The research report covers Overbond an exciting player in the fixed income space operating at the intersection of Fintech and capital markets.

* When was the company incorporated?

The company is based on Toronto, with offices in New York and Montreal. The company website does not include a corporate archive outlining history with a timeline of achievements etc. The closest information to date of incorporation is injection of $4.5M in Seed Financing in Jun-2016 from Morrison Partners; implying an incorporation prior. Separately, the LinkedIn profile of founder indicates a 2015 founding date. 

* Who are the founders of the company?

The public profile indicates a sole founder – Vuk Magdelinic. It is likely that at inception, founder leveraged his industry relationships and may have had other financial partners. An investor into the corporation would have access to these share holding patterns which are publicly unavailable.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founder and several key team members have significant industry and consulting experience. The problem the corporation aims to solve, has existed within the fixed income market for decades. It is extremely plausible that the ideation occurred during the industry stints of the founders. For e.g. Founder CEO spent 3 years in the Fixed Income Sales Trading, and Structured Products Origination team within CIBC implying real world experience confronting some of the structural realities of the fixed income market and developing potential solutions.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The company seems to have received only one round of funding - $4.5m in Jun 2016 provided by Morrison Capital Partners who assess Overbond’s ability to ‘Transform Investment Banking and Bond Issuance Market’. “Overbond’s experienced team is making a significant impact in institutional capital markets,” said David Morrison, president of Morrison Financial. “Our investment combined with Overbond’s vision will no doubt have a significant impact on how new bonds are issued.”
To date this is the only publicly available funding information. Since this initial round, it appears that the company is funding itself organically. Conservatively company’s operating expenses are likely to be in the $3m to $5m range (including salaries, rent on three locations, data and technology fees); given the size of this stream relative to initial funding suggests that Overbond has organically funded itself over the past 3 years.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Until recently, the fixed income markets have not embraced fintech as wholeheartedly as other asset classes including equities through utilization of AI, predictive analytics and machine learning in investment, research and trading decisions. 
To a large extent on the ‘buy side’ research is still bottom-up analyst driven, portfolios were largely manually built up based on fundamental views and execution was telephone based utilizing a short list of preferred brokers. In such an environment, potentially alpha (outperformance) generated by portfolio and research decisions could be negated by suboptimal trading performance. Another unwelcome by-product was the information asymmetry – a handful of large investors with deep trading relationships had access to the richest fills and the best execution. Key to efficiency in the marketplace is reducing (if not eliminating) this latency between ideation and execution by harnessing fintech.
Similarly, the ‘sell side’ i.e. fixed income issuers have not completely tapped fintech’s vast potential in predicting issuances and optimally pricing appropriately.
Overbond’s product suite attempts to address both needs as stated in their website (‘About Us’ )
“Overbond is an AI quantitative analytics provider for institutional fixed income capital markets. Overbond provides data aggregation solutions and comprehensive suite of AI algorithms for bond pricing, bond buyer matching, pre-trade signals and market surveillance.”

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Insights into intended customer can be gleaned from description above.

#### Institutional fixed income capital markets 
The institutional fixed income is massive given popularity of this funding conduit and its centrality in portfolio allocations. Conservatively, US daily trading volumes is $750b and annual issuances of Corporate debt about $3b (source SIFMA 2018 factbook). The market size in isolation is not very insightful to analyze Overbond’s service offering; however as outlined later in this case study it really is the addressable market space of certain ‘mid market’ fixed income issuers and managers that is more central to understanding what Overbond’s offerings.

#### Bond pricing and bond buyer matching
Geared to a mid market issuer that may not possess scale to establish its own analytics program e.g. HydroOne. Also targets mid sized asset managers that many not have in-house analytical capability or computing infrastructure

#### Pre-trade signals and market surveillance
Targets both ‘buy side’ i.e. asset managers that transact fixed income securities and ‘sell side’ i.e. issuers of fixed income through pre-trade pre-issue analytics an e.g. could be excess inventory of a certain issue appearing in dealer inventory which could trigger a buy to exploit short term supply imbalances in the market place i.e. when a security is priced advantageously relative to a similar credit

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Overbond  has benefited from a ‘first mover advantage’ within the Canadian fixed income space. Within the Canadian fixed income ecosystem, they are the first entrant that has identified this problem and sought to address in a structured mathematical manner by incorporating data and analytics tools. This first mover advantage has also likely secured them access to a deeper range of data sources than potential competitors. 
Candeal, the largest electronic trading platform in Canada is owned by the six largest Canadian banks. Overbond’s vendor neutral and independent status and ability to harness multiple data sources, and international feeds provide them a relatively unique value proposition.
Finally, Overbond’s location in the Toronto fintech pod, and ability to hire strong local talent including from the UofT Fintech SCS course is an advantage not directly available to other competitors located outside the major financial centers for e.g. in Bangalore, India.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

At a high level, Overbond has efficiently harnessed the power of AI, big data, predictive analytics and specific machine learning algorithms to build its service offerings. The product architecture includes:

| Stage        | Process and Technology                                                                             |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data gathering              | Harnesses big data to source data from several industry sources on millions of bond issuances.                                |
| Data Scrubbing               | Using supervised learning methods to prepare a clean learning set.   
| Feature Engineering          | Application of unsupervised learning algorithms to map fixed income specific features e.g. secondary spreads.                                                                 |
| Machine Learning Application | Applying an ensemble learning approach to predict issuance, pricing etc. <br>ML algorithms applied are kNN, logistics regression, support vector machines at this final stage. |


The key to success does not solely depend on utilizing a shiny algorithm or massive infrastructure but applying human intelligence to utilize the right algorithms and apply the correct set of hyperparameters. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Overbond operates within the fixed income institutional investor and issuer space within the larger capital markets vertical.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Until recently, the fixed income markets have not embraced fintech as wholeheartedly as other asset classes including equities through utilization of AI, predictive analytics and machine learning in investment, research, and trading decisions. 
This theme has manifested itself through the electronification of fixed income trading avenues and exchanges. Anecdotally, it is estimated that even in Canada, which has been a late adapter up to 80% of fixed income trading is electronic vs. ~ 30% in 2007. Per Overbond research, number of fixed income e-trading platforms in 2016 was 17 (in the US).
The electronification has levelled the playing field by increasing transparency, strengthening liquidity and permitted data and analytics providers like Overbond to offer tailored solutions across issuer, buyer and dealer space.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Most large asset managers have developed these skills inhouse aided by availability of domain expertise, bility to attract best in class talent and deep pockets to invest in these technologies. Firms like BlackRock (Alladin), AllianceBernstein (Abby and Prism) and Goldman Sachs have invested heavily in technology.
Limited intelligence exists on similar approaches by issuers of fixed income.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

As a start-up that is still private, it has been challenging to directly estimate the impact of Overbond. However, several secondary indicators imply that the company has carved a niche for itself in this space including:
1.	Organically funding operating costs including a strong tech team, three physical offices
* Offices located in expensive commercial locations including New York, Toronto and Montreal

2.	Maintenance of a strong profile on social media and frequent television appearances of CEO

3.	Conventional media and industry presence as outlined in the press relations section AND

4.	Case study with a large Ontario issuer rich in specifics implying that a live projectexecution rather than research undertaking

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

For a private company, metrics listed above and the fact that they have thrived without any additional funding injections are the only indicators available currently.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Several large asset managers and issuers have replicated Overbond’s technology and benefited from greater scale and deeper pockets. Overbond’s opportunity set lies in segmenting the issuer and asset manager markets to focus on mid and small size players that will find these offerings valuable; that do not have an ability to compete with a BlackRock or Goldman in buying shiniest and most expensive piece of technology.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This permits Overbond to focus on the mid-market space as large issuers and asset managers have already made considerable investments in this space. A case in point is the Candeal platform which is the largest electronic trading platform in Canada for rates, money market and derivatives. Candeal is jointly owned by the dealer arms of the 6 largest Canadian banks; and thereby is likely the analytics provider of choice for the large asset manager and treasury arms of these entities. This introduces a high barrier to entry Overbond to break into these entities and affirms its mid market focus.
Another vertical to consider is post trade compliance. With increased regulation, focussed on best execution and fiduciary responsibility this offering complements their pre-trade and issuance expertise. This also helps establish helpful metrics with clients i.e. percentage of their trades executed advantageously relative to composite.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

I envision Overbond offering their core issuance and pricing algorithms as a Software as a Service offering; which permits rapid deployment. A simplistic vision is an Excel plug-in, or an API that a portfolio manager can invoke to deploy a pre-trade pricing check; or a trader can use to assess liquidity on her blotter prior to executing a trade.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are appropriate for the mid-market space where Overbond can secure maximum ‘ bang for buck’ and address market optimally.
